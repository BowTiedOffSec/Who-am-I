Who am I

Welcome to my first repository! While I’m still learning the ins and outs of GitHub, this will serve as an About Me page for now.

 I’m currently on a journey to level up my tech skills in Web 3, cybersecurity, and learning to leverage AI and learn more about machine learning (sometimes to make me look smarter than I am!). As I continue to grow in these areas, I invite you to watch my progress in real-time as I work on taking my passion for tech as a hobby and moving it into something more!

My passion for cybersecurity has led me down a few exciting paths and while I want to do it all, I’m starting to find my stride and narrow down my interests and specialties. I’m working towards becoming a penetration tester and cybersecurity specialist, with a current focus on blockchain and smart contract security. Recently, I started learning Solidity to audit smart contracts and contribute to helping secure the Web 3 ecosystem.

My Goals:

    Build expertise in cyber security and smart contract security.
    Transition into full-time work in cybersecurity and Web 3 by earning experience freelancing or working on open-source projects.
    Compete in bug bounties and smart contract audits when I am ready.

Currently, I’m learning:

    Solidity for smart contract security.
    Python, Linux, and the basics of cybersecurity and penetration testing.
    Applying my operational experience with SCADA systems to understand security vulnerabilities and risks.

I’m looking to collaborate on projects related to Web 3, DeFi consulting, or cybersecurity. If you need a motivated part-time intern security analyst or researcher in Web 2 or Web 3, feel free to reach out!  I would love to opportunity to connect with some like-minded people and and build cool things

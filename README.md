# Who-am-I
This is my first repo.  I have no idea how to use this yet but it will serve as an about me for now. I’m @BowTiedOffSec thank you for stopping by!  Watch me in real time as this boomer works dillegently to learn a new skill set and try to level up my skills in web 3, cyber security and learning to use AI to make me appear smarter then I am. 
Currently, my passion for cyber security has led me down a few paths and I am finding my stride. I’m interested in working towards developing my skills to eventually work as a penetration tester and cyber security specialist with a focus on SCADA and PLC.  I also have a strong interest in crypto currency and smart contract security.  Recently I have strated learning solidity with the intent to learn to audit smart contracts and add value to the web 3 ecosystem.  My plan is to build up these skills to transition out of my current profession and move fulltime into tech.  I am hoping to compete in bug bounties and smart contract audits one day soon!
I’m currently learning solidity for smart contract security, python, linux and the basics of cyber security and penetration testing.  I have operational experience with SCADA systmes and am working to understand this system from a security perspective.  
I’m looking to collaborate on projects where I can lend a hand doing some work in web 3 or cyber security.  Feel free to reach out if you have space for a part time security analyst in web 2 or web 3!   How to reach me:   Here on github or also on twitter @BowtiedOffSec
